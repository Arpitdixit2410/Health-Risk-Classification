# Health-Risk-Classification
Predicts health risk (low/medium/high) using Random Forest based on BMI, exercise, and junk food habits with visualizations.
Model Inputs
BMI: Body Mass Index

Exercise Hours: Weekly exercise duration

Junk Food Frequency: Frequency of junk food consumption per week

🚀 How to Use
Upload your dataset in Google Colab.

Run the notebook to train the Random Forest Classifier.

Check the accuracy, classification report, and visualizations (confusion matrix, feature importance, pairplot).

📊 Visualizations
Confusion Matrix: Evaluates model performance.

Feature Importance: Identifies key factors affecting risk level.

Pairplot: Visualizes relationships between features and risk level.

📝 Example Prediction
You can enter your data (e.g., BMI = 27.5, Exercise Hours = 5, Junk Food Frequency = 2) to predict your health risk level.
