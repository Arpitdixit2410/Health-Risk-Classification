# Health-Risk-Classification
Predicts health risk (low/medium/high) using Random Forest based on BMI, exercise, and junk food habits with visualizations.
Model Inputs
BMI: Body Mass Index

Exercise Hours: Weekly exercise duration

Junk Food Frequency: Frequency of junk food consumption per week

üöÄ How to Use
Upload your dataset in Google Colab.

Run the notebook to train the Random Forest Classifier.

Check the accuracy, classification report, and visualizations (confusion matrix, feature importance, pairplot).

üìä Visualizations
Confusion Matrix: Evaluates model performance.

Feature Importance: Identifies key factors affecting risk level.

Pairplot: Visualizes relationships between features and risk level.

üìù Example Prediction
You can enter your data (e.g., BMI = 27.5, Exercise Hours = 5, Junk Food Frequency = 2) to predict your health risk level.
 Results
The Random Forest model accurately predicted health risk levels using BMI, exercise hours, and junk food frequency. BMI and exercise were the most important features. The model showed strong performance with high precision and minimal misclassifications.
